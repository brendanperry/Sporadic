# Short Version:

We don't collect any personal data.

# Long Version:

We really don't. We don't even have a database or a server. 

The only information that leaves the device is if you choose to sync to iCloud. This is used to maintain your stats in the case that you get a new phone. None of that data is stored by us, and it can be disabled entirely in the iPhone settings by turning off iCloud for the app.

This data is a key-value pair. 

For example: `"Run" : 5`

Don't want to take our word for it? Have a look for yourself. The app is open source.

Our team uses this app, too. We want our privacy respected. *We build apps that we want to use.*
