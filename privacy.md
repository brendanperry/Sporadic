The only data that we have is what you enter into Sporadic. This includes your profile information, groups, challenges, and so on. This is all required for the app's function, and none of this data is sold to third parties.

We use OneSignal to provide push notifications. OneSignal does collect basic analytics data.

OneSignal collects user First Session, Last Session, Session Count, Total Usage Duration, and Notification Clicks

OneSignal creates an user-level ID called OneSignal ID for Analytics and App functionality. The OneSignal ID is not linked to the user's identity.

Don't want to take our word for it? Have a look for yourself. The app is open source.

Our team uses this app, too. We want our privacy respected. *We build apps that we want to use.*
